        <h2> Purpose </h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website will be to increase sales and engagement for the food truck.
            </p>
        <h3> Audience </h3>
            <p>
                The audience will be for customers who want to see the menu. This will be either new customers or customers
                that are not familiar with asian style street food and need a visual or ingredient list.
            </p>
        <h4> Goal </h4>
                <p>
                    The goal is to show customers what the food truck is about and to make ordering food easier for those that are not familiar with asian style street foods.
                    It also will increase sales and widen the customer outreach
                </p>

        <h5> Persona </h5>
            <p>
                My persona is Julio. He is 28 and a foodie. He is very tech-savvy, he has an Iphone 13, an Ipad, therefore he only uses
                safari. He loves food as much as he loves technology, he is always looking up new foods to try. He will use the website to
                understand what kind of food is sold and determine what he will order. The website has photos that help alleviate the frustration of not knowing
                what to order.
