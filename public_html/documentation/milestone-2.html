    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
</header>
<article>
    <p> My website will be structured in the following manner </p>
    <h2> Story </h2>
    <p>
        This section will introduce Isaac to the world. I will include a photo of him in front of the food truck and
        give a little background story of the food truck.
    </p>
    <h3> Menu </h3>
    <p>
        The menu will be a carousel of photos of the food. I have opted for a format that will showcase the food.
        The photo will be first and then under it a description and price. I strongly believe that when ordering it
        is very important for people to see what they are getting.
    </p>
    <h4> Contact Us </h4>
    <p>
        This section will allow clients to reach out if they have questions about the food or if they want to hire
        the food truck for a catering event. This is also where the social media links will be for further engagement.
    </p>

    <h5> Color scheme</h5>
    <p>
        The color scheme if the website will be black and yellow with red. I know it will be a difficult task to make
        it accessible and aesthetically pleasing, but I want to stick to the color of the food truck. Since I know
        the colors are a lot I will keep the website minimal with clean lines.
